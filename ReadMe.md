This is my Hacker Special Challenge (4,5,7): Showcase Portfolio.

It contains information about me, my skills, my certificates and the projects I have worked on.

I designed and created a one-pager website. The design of the website is consistent with the Portfolio Abstract Document Design.

To run the project use command: node app.js

For this project I have used:
-node.js
-express.js
-mondodb/ mongoose

I have created a collection in Atlas (MongoDb) and stored the information about my projects there. Via API I read the info and display it on the browser
